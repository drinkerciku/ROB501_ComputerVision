    """
    Fast stereo correspondence algorithm.

    This function computes a stereo disparity image from left stereo 
    image Il and right stereo image Ir. Only disparity values within
    the bounding box region (inclusive) are evaluated.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    Il    - Left stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    Ir    - Right stereo image, m x n pixel np.array, greyscale.
    bbox  - 2x2 np.array, bounding box, relative to left image, from top left
            corner to bottom right corner (inclusive). (x, y) in columns.
    maxd  - Integer, maximum disparity value; disparities must be within zero
            to maxd inclusive (i.e., don't search beyond maxd).

    Returns:
    --------
    Id  - Disparity image (map) as np.array, same size as Il.

    # Hints:
    #
    #  - Loop over each image row, computing the local similarity measure, then
    #    aggregate. At the border, you may replicate edge pixels, or just avoid
    #    using values outside of the image.
    #
    #  - You may hard-code any parameters you require in this function.
    #
    #  - Use whatever window size you think might be suitable.
    #
    #  - Optimize for runtime AND for clarity.

    ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
    
    This algorithm uses the a LoG filter to preprocess in data to put an 
    emphasise on the contours and differentiate textureless surfaces - the
    variance was selected small enough to not change the intensity of the
    pixels significantly. An SSD metric was used instead of SAD to provide 
    a more precise disparity value - penalizing higher differences in pixel
    values. Prior to returning results, a 2D median filter was applied to improve
    on the regions where no good disparity was located which accounts
    for the uncertainty in test case 3 as the image captured might also be
    temporally different - filling occlusion regions. Moreover, the pixel we
    are querying on is not always on the center of the window - the window
    is slided around the pixel according to its size and the distance from the 
    RoI edges.
    
    Note: NCC algorithm provides better results but it was slow on autograder :(.
